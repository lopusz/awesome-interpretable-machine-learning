However, many existing VI measures are not\ncomparable across model types, can obscure implicit assumptions about the data\ngenerating distribution, or can give seemingly incoherent results when multiple\nprediction models fit the data well. In this paper we propose a framework of VI\nmeasures for describing how much any model class (e.g. all linear models of\ndimension p), any model-fitting algorithm (e.g. Ridge regression with fixed\nregularization parameter), or any individual prediction model (e.g. a single\nlinear model with fixed coefficient vector), relies on covariate(s) of\ninterest.

Therefore, it is crucial that domain specialists can\nunderstand and analyze actions and pre- dictions, even of the most complex\nneural network architectures. Despite these arguments neural networks are often\ntreated as black boxes. In the attempt to alleviate this short- coming many\nanalysis methods were proposed, yet the lack of reference implementations often\nmakes a systematic comparison between the methods a major effort. The presented\nlibrary iNNvestigate addresses this by providing a common interface and\nout-of-the- box implementation for many analysis methods, including the\nreference implementation for PatternNet and PatternAttribution as well as for\nLRP-methods. To demonstrate the versatility of iNNvestigate, we provide an\nanalysis of image classifications for variety of state-of-the-art neural\nnetwork architectures.\n", "authors": {"author": [{"forenames": "Maximilian", "keyname": "Alber"}, {"forenames": "Sebastian", "keyname": "Lapuschkin"}, {"forenames": "Philipp", "keyname": "Seegerer"}, {"forenames": "Miriam", "keyname": "H\u00e4gele"}, {"forenames": "Kristof T.", "keyname": "Sch\u00fctt"}, {"forenames": "Gr\u00e9goire", "keyname": "Montavon"}, {"forenames": "Wojciech", "keyname": "Samek"}, {"forenames": "Klaus-Robert", "keyname": "M\u00fcller"}, {"forenames": "Sven", "keyname": "D\u00e4hne"}, {"forenames": "Pieter-Jan", "keyname": "Kindermans"}]}, "categories": "cs.LG stat.ML", "created": "2018-08-13", "id": "1808.04260", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "title": "iNNvestigate neural networks!"}}}}, "request": {"_attrib": {"identifier": "oai:arXiv.org:1808.04260", "metadataPrefix": "arXiv", "verb": "GetRecord"}, "val": "http://export.arxiv.org/oai2"}, "responseDate": "2019-04-18T21:31:13Z"}

Moreover, examination of distillation error makes the method\napplicable to the problems with low tolerance to interpretation mistakes.\nTechnically, YASENN distills the network with an ensemble of layer-wise\ngradient boosting decision trees and encodes the sequences of neuron\nactivations with leaf indices. The finite number of unique codes induces a\npartitioning of the input space. Each partition may be described in a variety\nof ways, including examination of an interpretable model (e.g. a logistic\nregression or a decision tree) trained to discriminate between objects of those\npartitions.

In\naddition to using models for prediction, the ability to interpret what a model\nhas learned is receiving an increasing amount of attention. However, this\nincreased focus has led to considerable confusion about the notion of\ninterpretability. In particular, it is unclear how the wide array of proposed\ninterpretation methods are related, and what common concepts can be used to\nevaluate them.\n  We aim to address these concerns by defining interpretability in the context\nof machine learning and introducing the Predictive, Descriptive, Relevant (PDR)\nframework for discussing interpretations. The PDR framework provides three\noverarching desiderata for evaluation: predictive accuracy, descriptive\naccuracy and relevancy, with relevancy judged relative to a human audience.\nMoreover, to help manage the deluge of interpretation methods, we introduce a\ncategorization of existing techniques into model-based and post-hoc categories,\nwith sub-groups including sparsity, modularity and simulatability. To\ndemonstrate how practitioners can use the PDR framework to evaluate and\nunderstand interpretations, we provide numerous real-world examples. These\nexamples highlight the often under-appreciated role played by human audiences\nin discussions of interpretability. Finally, based on our framework, we discuss\nlimitations of existing methods and directions for future work. We hope that\nthis work will provide a common vocabulary that will make it easier for both\npractitioners and researchers to discuss and choose from the full range of\ninterpretation methods.\n", "authors": {"author": [{"forenames": "W.

{"0KEY_": "s:94770d1ea1192c05a6922712200689344a742d81", "abstract": "Black-box risk scoring models permeate our lives, yet are typically proprietary and opaque. We propose a transparent model distillation approach to detect bias in such models. Model distillation was originally designed to distill knowledge from a large, complex teacher model to a faster, simpler student model without significant loss in prediction accuracy. We add a third restriction - transparency. In this paper we use data sets that contain two labels to train on: the risk score predicted by a black-box model, as well as the actual outcome the risk score was intended to predict. This allows us to compare models that predict each label. For a particular class of student models - interpretable tree additive models with pairwise interactions (GA2Ms) - we provide confidence intervals for the difference between the risk score and actual outcome models. This presents a new method for detecting bias in black-box risk scores by assessing if contributions of protected features to the risk score are statistically different from their contributions to the actual outcome.", "arxivId": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "145176257", "name": "Sarah Tan", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/author/145176257"}, {"authorId": "145727186", "name": "Rich Caruana", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/author/145727186"}, {"authorId": "145403451", "name": "Giles Hooker", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/author/145403451"}, {"authorId": "91993942", "name": "Yin Lou", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/author/91993942"}], "citationVelocity": 5, "citations": [{"arxivId": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "144444592", "name": "Ajay Chander", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/author/144444592"}, {"authorId": "145443836", "name": "Ramya Srinivasan", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/author/145443836"}, {"authorId": "1693550", "name": "Suhas E.
